# **Telecom Customer Churn Analysis**

This project analyzes customer churn for a telecom company using Python and its data analysis libraries. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insightful visualizations to understand the factors influencing churn.

## **Project Overview**
Customer churn is a significant challenge in the telecom industry. This project aims to:
1. Analyze and visualize key factors driving customer churn.
2. Identify actionable insights to reduce churn.
3. Provide an overview of customer behavior using visualizations and statistical techniques.

## **Features**
- **Data Preprocessing**: 
  - Handled missing values.
  - Converted categorical variables to numeric where necessary.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
  - Visualized key metrics such as churn distribution, tenure, and monthly charges.
  - Created a correlation heatmap to identify relationships between variables.
- **Insights and Recommendations**:
  - Based on analysis, identified patterns in churn and actionable business insights.

## **Technologies Used**
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
  - `numpy`: For numerical computations.
  - `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For data visualization.
  - `scikit-learn`: For preprocessing and machine learning (optional, if you add a model).
- **Environment**: Google Colab

## **Files in the Repository**
1. `telecom_churn_analysis.ipynb`: The main Jupyter notebook with all code and visualizations.
2. `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv`: Dataset used in the analysis.
3. `requirements.txt`: List of Python libraries required to run the project.
4. `README.md`: Project description and instructions.

## **Project Insights**
- **Key Observations**:
  - Customers with higher monthly charges are more likely to churn.
  - Long-term customers (higher tenure) are less likely to churn.
  - Paperless billing and specific contract types have significant churn rates.

- **Recommendations**:
  - Focus on customer retention strategies for high-risk segments identified during the analysis.
  - Improve service quality and offer incentives for long-term contracts.
